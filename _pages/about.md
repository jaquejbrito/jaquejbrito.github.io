This is my personal home page. I am a PhD on Computer Science by the University of São Paulo, Brazil. My thesis was primarily focused on the processing of multiple joins (Star Joins) in distributed systems. In 2016, I did an internship at the University of California San Diego, with Prof. Yannis Papakonstantinou.

My primary research interests are in improving the performance of decision-making systems and large databases hosted in distributed systems. This involves the use of more recent technologies in combination with well established concepts and technologies (e.g. OLAP in Data Warehouses).

I am currently located in Los Angeles, California.
